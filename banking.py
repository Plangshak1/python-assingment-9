# ===== TASK 4: Bank Account Withdrawal System =====
# Create TWO custom exceptions:
# - InsufficientFundsError: raised when withdrawal amount exceeds balance
# - InvalidTransactionError: raised when amount is negative or zero
# 
# The function should:
# - Accept prompt, current balance, and minimum balance (for overdraft protection)
# - Validate withdrawal amount is a valid number (raise ValueError if not)
# - Check if amount is positive (raise InvalidTransactionError if not)
# - Check if withdrawal would bring balance below minimum (raise InsufficientFundsError if so)
# - Return the withdrawal amount if valid
# - Keep asking until valid input
